# Pneumonia-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-Models
Developed a web-based diagnostic tool using CNN models for early pneumonia detection from chest X-rays.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

* Source: [Kaggle - Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/pediatric-pneumonia-chest-xray)

ðŸ§  Model Pipeline Overview

1. Data Loading & Preprocessing
   * Dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets.
   * Images are resized to `(128, 128)` and normalized.
   * Extensive **data augmentation** is applied using `ImageDataGenerator`.

2. Model Architecture
   * The project uses **Transfer Learning** with a pre-trained **VGG19** model from Keras Applications.
   * The base model is followed by layers like `GlobalAveragePooling2D`, `Dense`, and `Dropout` for binary classification.

3. Training & Evaluation
   * Loss function: `binary_crossentropy`
   * Optimizer: `Adam`
   * Performance metrics: **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**
   * Uses callbacks like `ModelCheckpoint` and `ReduceLROnPlateau`
   * Visualizes training curves to assess model performance.

4. Deployment-Ready Output
   * Final trained model is saved for future inference.
   * Test-time predictions are performed on sample X-ray images.
